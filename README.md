# NBCares/ParaDYM Website
## Main Features of System
The main functionality of this site for most users is a mobile-responsive calendar which hosts community support events. This site is designed so that 3rd-party organizations that have been created by the admin account can submit events to be added to the calendar. This is designed so that any 3rd party that may want to sign up must contact NB Cares to request an account. This gives NB Cares the ultimate decision-making power over which organizations are allowed to submit events, cutting down on irrelevant event submissions. Once an event has been submitted, the admin has the ability to approve or deny each individual event. Only once an event has been approved by the admin, it becomes publicly viewable.
